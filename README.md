# Lightning Web Runtime Recipes

A collection of sample projects for Lightning Web Runtime (LWR) ([source](https://github.com/salesforce/lwr)). Each recipe demonstrates how to code a specific use case. From Hello World to Single Page Applications to resource bundling and chunking, there is a recipe for that!
