# Lightning Web Runtime Recipes

Lightning Web Runtime (LWR) is a flexible platform that supports a wide range of different web applications. Its features are composable and pluggable. LWR at its simplest is a non-opinionated way to load the modules you need for your use case. Some benefits of LWR out of the box are:

- Performance. Our bar is set at sub-second full page loads.
- Enjoyable local development experience.
- All the power of LWC and the Salesforce platform at your disposal.

## Sample Projects

This repo consists of a collection of sample projects, called recipes. Each recipe demonstrates how to code a specific use case. From [Hello World](./packages/hello-world) to single page applications to resource bundling and chunking, there is a recipe for that!

All recipes are installed when you clone this repo. Go to [packages](https://github.com/salesforce/lwr-recipes/tree/master/packages) to see all the recipes. Each recipe has its own README that walks you through how to configure and run it. 

## Get Started

LWR doesn't yet have a `create` command, so the easiest way to start building your own project is to copy one of the recipes and modify the copy. Run a recipe in your local environment by following the [get started](./doc/get_started.md) steps.

If you'd like to contribute to this project, see our [contributing guide](./doc/CONTRIBUTING.md).
