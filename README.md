# Lightning Web Runtime Recipes

Lightning Web Runtime (LWR) enables you to build digital experiences that meet the high scale, security, and performance demands of consumer-scale web applications. LWR at its simplest is a non-opinionated way to configure and load the modules, services, and dependency providers you need to build an app.

To learn more, see [Overview of Building LWR Apps](./doc/business_overview.md).

## Sample Projects

This repo consists of a collection of sample projects, called recipes. Each recipe demonstrates how to code a specific use case. From [Hello World](./packages/hello-world) to single page applications to resource bundling and chunking, there is a recipe for that!

All recipes are installed when you clone this repo. Go to [packages](https://github.com/salesforce/lwr-recipes/tree/master/packages) to see all the recipes. Each recipe has its own README that walks you through how to configure and run it.

To learn more, see [Configure a LWR Project](./doc/config.md).

## Get Started

LWR doesn't yet have a `create` command, so the easiest way to start building your own project is to copy one of the recipes and modify the copy. Run a recipe in your local environment by following the [get started](./doc/get_started.md) steps.

If you'd like to contribute to this project, see our [contributing guide](./doc/CONTRIBUTING.md).
