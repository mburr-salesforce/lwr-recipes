# Introduction to Lightning Web Runtime (LWR)

Lightning Web Runtime (LWR) is a flexible platform that supports a wide range of different web applications. Its features are composable and pluggable. LWR at its simplest is a non-opinionated way to configure and load the modules, services, and dependency providers to meet your use case.

LWR describes any configurable aspects of the application in a well-defined, portable format. Because of this flexible deployment model, you can deploy on a variety of runtime environments, depending on your use case. For example, LWR works in a local NodeJS runtime, as a stand-alone instance in Heroku, or as a Java runtime deployed and configured for an opinionated platform.
